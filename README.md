# TICLinky

An old project to show on a web page the current data send by a Linky electricity meter.

It was meant to run on a Raspberry Pi Zero W, connected to the TIC output of the meter.

I don't use this project anymore, since I now use Home assistant and an ESP32 with ESPHome to get the values from the meter.
